# Shiny-Survey Tool v.01

Sorry, none of the code has any comments in it yet.  I will come back and do that soon (hopefully).  I wanted to get it out as quickly as possible less I might not get it out at all.

To add questions or possible answers just modify the Qlist.csv document.

You can add more columns for additional potential answers.  Any answer slots left "" will be ignored.

You can find a demonstration at:
